Compling the dgswe code requires a MPI library and the lapack library to be installed.
Plotting the results require ghostscript and latex to be installed along with the package textpos.

The python script run_case.py will compile the dgswe and plotting codes, copy them into the
example directory, run the simulation, and plot the results.

The clean_case.py script will delete all files generated by the running the example.

This probelm will take around an hour to run on an HPC cluster using 192 cores.
