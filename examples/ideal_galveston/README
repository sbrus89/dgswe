This directory contains the files to run an idealized Galveston Bay tidal problem with curved boundaries and high-order bathymetry.

See Section 5.4 of 

Brus, Steven R. Efficiency improvements for modeling coastal hydrodynamics through the application of high-order discontinuous Galerkin solutions to the shallow water equations. Diss. University Of Notre Dame, 2017.

Compling the dgswe code requires a MPI library and the lapack library to be installed.
Plotting the results require ghostscript and latex to be installed along with the package textpos.

The python script run_case.py will compile the dgswe and plotting codes, copy them into the
example directory, run the simulation, and plot the results.

The clean_case.py script will delete all files generated by the running the example.

This probelm will take around 15 minutes to run on a laptop using 4 cores.
