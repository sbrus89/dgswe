Compling the dgswe code requires the gfortran complier and the lapack library to be installed.
Plotting the results require ghostscript and latex to be installed along with the package textpos.

The python script run_case.py will compile the dgswe and plotting codes, copy them into the
example directory, run the simulation, and plot the results.

The clean_case.py script will delete all files generated by the running the example.

This probelm will take around 10 minutes to run on a laptop using a single core.
